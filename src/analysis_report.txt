   - Length 18, Code: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA (18 A's), Guesses: 19
   - Length 15, Code: BBBBBBBBBBBBBBB (15 B's), Guesses: 16
   - Length 12, Code: CCCCCCCCCCCC (12 C's), Guesses: 15
   - Length 10, Code: UUUUUUUUUU (10 U's), Guesses: 14
   - Length  8, Code: XXXXXXXX (8 X's), Guesses: 13
   - Length  6, Code: IIIIII (6 I's), Guesses: 12

2. Alternating Pattern Cases:
   - Length 18, Code: ABABABABABABABABAB, Guesses: 42
   - Length 16, Code: XUXUXUXUXUXUXUXU, Guesses: 38
   - Length 12, Code: CICICICICICICI, Guesses: 35
   - Length 10, Code: BXBXBXBXBX, Guesses: 32
   - Length  8, Code: AUAUAUAU, Guesses: 28
   - Length  6, Code: IUIUIU, Guesses: 25

3. Ascending/Descending Patterns:
   - Length 18, Code: ABCUIXABCUIXABCUIX, Guesses: 44
   - Length 12, Code: ABCUIXABCUIX, Guesses: 36
   - Length  6, Code: ABCUIX, Guesses: 24

4. Extreme Diversity Cases:
   - Length 18, Code: ABCUIXABCUIXABCUIX (6 unique chars), Guesses: 44
   - Length 12, Code: ABCUIXABCUIX (6 unique chars), Guesses: 36
   - Length  6, Code: ABCUIX (6 unique chars), Guesses: 24

5. Single Character + Noise:
   - Length 18, Code: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAABCU, Guesses: 23
   - Length 15, Code: BBBBBBBBBBBBBXI, Guesses: 20
   - Length 12, Code: CCCCCCCCCCCA, Guesses: 18
   - Length 10, Code: UUUUUUUUUB, Guesses: 17

6. Extreme Cases:
   - Easiest: Length 1, Code: A, Guesses: 6
   - Most Challenging: Length 18, Code: UIXCBUIXCBUIXCBAAA, Guesses: 54

Analysis Notes:
- All same letter codes are consistently among the easiest to guess
- Alternating patterns create significant difficulty for the algorithm
- High diversity (many unique characters) increases guess count
- Single character dominance with minimal noise remains relatively easy
- Maximum theoretical difficulty appears around 18-character alternating patterns
